<h1>Hello Yassin Omar Samir Darweesh</h1>
<p>If you're reading this; you've been hacked, I'd hate to inform you that the files on your pc have been encrypted and you need to send exactly 200 dollars worth of bitcoin to the follow ip address to get your stuff back and if you press alt + f4 I will do absolutely nothing because this isn't real.</p>
